## 🌟 My Creative Approach

- 🔥 **Minimal and Clean UI:** Prioritized clarity and whitespace to reduce clutter.
- 👥 **User-Centered Flow:** Designed flows with everyday users in mind (e.g., quick transfer, QR payment).
- 💡 **Color Psychology:** Used soft blues for trust + pops of color for action triggers (CTA buttons, offers).
